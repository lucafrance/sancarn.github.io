      To date, (23/03/2019), I have worked in a civil engineering company developing software solutions
      for the water industry. These solutions are commonly written in VBA, JavaScript, MapBasic or Ruby.
      The software I have used are namely MapInfo, InfoWorks ICM (Hydraulic Simulation software) and
      of course Microsoft Office.

      It may be the case that, long term, I will be developing software solutions worldwide for more than
      1 single sector, so this page is to leave open that possibility.
