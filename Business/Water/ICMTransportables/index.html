          <h1>Parsing ICM Standalone and Transportable databases</h1>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>

          <p>
            Transportable databases are one of the easiest (and fundamental) methods hydraulic modellers use to share data. A consultant might submit their hydraulic models to the client via ICM transportables. Unfortunately, many clients do not have access to InfoWorks or InfoNet meaning that validation that the consultant has actually done the work is difficult.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given that it is vitally important for companies to be able to check their data, it is also extremely important that there are cheap and easy solutions to check the contents of transportable databases without requiring expensive modelling software.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, it is of my opinion that it is totally unethical to have a paywall preventing an organisation/individual from reading their own data. I am no lawyer, but there may be grounds to suggest that this is even in violation of GDPR. Quoting from <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-data-portability/">ICO.org.uk</a>:
          </p>
          
          <blockquote>
              Where no specific format is in common use within your industry or sector, you should provide personal data using open formats such as CSV, XML and JSON. You may also find that these formats are the easiest for you to use when answering data portability requests.
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>
            Since 'personal data' can be stored in a transportable database this may be of violation without an open format specification. Perhaps this is something that needs to be looked into further by Innovyze.
          </p>

          <p>
            For all of the reasons above I deemed it necessary to build an open source library which can read InfoWorks and InfoNet Transportables. I started this project about 2.5 years ago, however soon after I started I hit a brick wall, until last week when I hit the jackpot.
          </p>

          <h1>Transportable database structure</h1>

          <p>
            About a year ago I posted an article on LinkedIn about understanding the InfoWorks CS database structure. Within this article I briefly covered the structure of transportable databases. I explained how, 1 year prior to writing the article, I had come across an error while trying to open a corrupt transportable database:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <i>
                Error extracting file Globals.Dat into ... error in <b>zipfile (2)</b>.
            </i>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            At this point curiosity got the best of me and I opened the transportable database in 7-zip to take a peak inside. Below is an interactive example of an unzipped transportable database. All files which contain binary data have been removed for now.
          </p>

          <script>
              $(function(){
                window.transportable = new Transportable("./libs/Transportable.icmt")
                window.transportable.onLoad(function(){
                  window.transportable.toFileViewer("#TDBEG1");
                })
              })
          </script>
          <div id="TDBEG1"></div>

          <p>
            Ever since I discovered that you could unzip a transportable, I began wondering which other data could be extracted from transportable databases into other applications. The possibilities seemed endless.
          </p>

          <h2>Investigating the raw files</h2>

          <p>
            After the above transportable database shown is loaded in ICM it has the following database structure:
          </p>

          <script>
            $(function(){
              //window.transportable = new Transportable("./libs/Transportable.icmt")
              window.transportable.onLoad(function(){
                window.transportable.toTreeViewer("#TDBEG2");
              })
            })
          </script>
          <div id="TDBEG2"></div>
          
          <p>
            So somehow the file structure above is morphed into the transportable database structure. But the question is... How?
          </p>

          <p>
            If we look into the files we see that a transportable database item contains what appears to be a list of Parent and Child IDs, under <code>#Children</code> and <code>#Parent</code> keys. So let's expand these out and see what we are left with! You might also notice that some files contain an <code>ID</code> key, however this ID directly relates to the number in the name of the file, and doesn't relate to the IDs represented in <code>#Children</code> and <code>#Parent</code>.
          </p>

          <script>
            $(function(){
              if(!vis) return;
              const tdb = window.transportable
              tdb.onLoad(function(){
                //Make links array
                links = [];
                tdb.items.forEach(function(item,index){
                  if(item.isModelObject || item.isRootObject){
                    const guid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx".replace(/x/g,e=>"0123456789ABCDEF"[Math.floor(Math.random()*16)]);
                    if(item.parent_id||item.child_ids){
                      //Get parent links
                      links.push(
                        {from:item.parent_id, to:guid, label:item.zipName}
                      );

                      //Get children links
                      item.child_ids.forEach(function(child_id){
                        if(child_id) links.push(
                          {from:guid, to:child_id, title:item.zipName}
                        );
                      });
                    };
                  };
                });
                
                //Make nodes array
                onodes = {};
                links.forEach(function(link){
                  onodes[link.from] = {id:link.from,title:link.from};
                  onodes[link.to]   = {id:link.to,title:link.to};
                });
                nodes = Object.values(onodes).filter(e=>e.title!=undefined);
                
                //Make vis network
                const visNodes = new vis.DataSet(nodes);
                const visLinks = new vis.DataSet(links);
                const container = $("#TDBEG3")[0];
                const network = new vis.Network(container, {nodes:nodes,edges:links},{interaction:{hover:true}});
                window.nodes = nodes;
              });
            });
          </script>
          <div id="TDBEG3" style="height:300px;"></div>

          <p>
            In the diagram, links represent the files which define connections. Hoverring over the link will tell you which file the link is defined in. The file which defines the link's ID is unknown however.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, a particular link e.g. the link from the Transportable Database to the Master Group.
          </p>

          <pre>0 -> 433 -> 4272</pre>

          <p>
            Is split into 2 seperate trees.
          </p>

          <pre>0   -> ??? -> 4272</pre>
          <p>and</p>
          <pre>??? -> 433 -> ???</pre>
          
          <p>
            It is possible to decipher this from the diagram because the Master Group has 25 children in both trees, and is the only object which indeed has 25 children. Thus these 2 must match and thus <code>0->433->4272</code> and the links to all other children can be made from here. However the same is not true for the children of the Asset Groups. All asset groups have 1 child so this trick cannot be used here.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, it can be Mathematically proven that the ids of the parents and children are not sufficient for the production of a tree. Any node must define it's own id. After the id of the node is defined then either the parents or children may be defined.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately this means that we are missing some data. There must be some additional data stored regarding each zip item. At first, I thought it may be stored in <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams/">alternate data streams</a> attached to the zip items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next I assumed that the data was stored in the Wallaby 2 file. This file contains all data related to model/collection/distribution networks stored in the transportable database. However then I realised that databases could be created without any of these files.
          </p>
          <p>
            My next idea was to look in the various blob files spread throughout the database. However as with the wallaby 2 files, transportable databases could be made without blob files yet still have complex structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point I stopped and proceded onto other projects... Recently, 2 years later, I revisited the project. I just so happened to have the following tree structure:
          </p>

          <!--< Transportable database validation objects >-->
          <script>
            $(function(){
              const t_validation = new Transportable("./libs/Transportable Examples/Validations.icmt")
              t_validation.onLoad(function(){
                t_validation.toFileViewer("#TDBEG4");
              })
            })
          </script>
          <div id="TDBEG4"></div>

          <p>
            Within <code>AG1.DAT</code> the children string: <code>#Children,1,"(364,620)"</code> was present. It dawned on me that <code>620</code> was an extremely round number to land an ID on and that the difference was approximately 250. By taking the difference of the 2 IDs <code>620-364</code> we get <code>256</code>. To me, this set off alarm bells and if you've been programming for a while you'd likely agree. <code>256</code> or <code>2^8</code> is a really interesting number to seperate 2 unique IDs.
          </p>

          <p>
            So let's assume all sequential IDs are seperated by 256. Let's try to verify this is the case with our first example. If we look into the data in MASG1.DAT (the Master group which contains many asset groups), we see children IDs as follows:
          </p>

          <pre>#Children,1,"(432,688,944,1200,1456,1712,2224,2480,2736,2992,3248,3504,3760,4016,4272,4528,4784,5040,5296,5552,5808,6064,6320,6576,7088)"</pre>

          <p>
            If we add 256 to each ID we get the next one as required.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Determining the ID</h2>

          <p>
              So it seems 256 is always used as a seperator but how do we determine what the ID of a particular file is? The formula I use is as follows:
          </p>

          <script>
            $(function(){
              katex.render("id = id_{type} + 256 \\times id_{cumulative}", $("#katex1")[0], {
                  throwOnError: false
              });
            });
          </script>
          <center>
              <div id="katex1"></div>
          </center>

          <p>
            Ultimately the id depends on 2 parts of the file name:
          </p>

          <p>
            <center>
              <div style="display: inline-block; font-style: oblique;">
                  <span style="background-color: rgb(235, 137, 137);float:left;padding:3px">AG</span>
                  <span style="background-color: rgb(154, 247, 247);float:left;padding:3px">12</span>
                  <span style="background-color: rgb(185, 185, 185);float:left;padding:3px">.DAT</span>
              </div>
            </center>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The <span style="background-color: rgb(235, 137, 137);">red section</span> relates to <i>id<sub>type</sub></i> . This is a 1-to-1 representation with each model object type being attributed to it's own numeric <i>id<sub>type</sub></i> . The <span style="background-color: rgb(154, 247, 247);">blue section</span> is equal to <i>id<sub>cumulative</sub></i> . So in the case of <code>AG12.DAT</code> the type is <code>AG</code> which can be translated into the number <code>176</code>. So ultimately our equation becomes <code>id = 176+256*12 = 3248</code>. Now that you know how transportable databases work, you can verify this for yourself!
          </p>

          <h2>Open Source JavaScript Library</h2>
          <p>
            I have created an open source JavaScript library which implements an algorithm allowing you to read transportable databases in the browser, and in desktop applications with NodeJS server. The source code is hosted on github. Please see the repository readme for documentation regarding the API. I've tried to build it as flexible as possible. Let me know how you get on with it!
          </p>

          <p>
            I have also created a few demos to help demonstrate the library in action!
          </p>

          <h3>Limitations and community contributions</h3>

          <p>
            Currently there are a few limitations with the library. The library itself is a basis ready for extension. Currently the library does not contain any specific objects. For example, it would be helpful if Runs related directly to the network, waste water, trade water profiles and rain events which they are inserting into simulations. Although this is easy to implement using the TransportableItem type system, specialised objects still should be created to handle these extra relationships, extending the library further.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may have noticed that when it comes to layer lists, (e.g. <code>LL1.DAT</code>), the file which contains the parent and children data does not also include the layer list data itself. This data is stored in the <code>LL1Blob.DAT</code> binary file. I am still unaware of any format specification for reading these files, and they almost look encrypted. I have already tried decompressing them however it seems this cannot be done to the file as a whole. Ultimately the format of these files is still unknown to me, so if anyone has time to invest in decoding these files that would be fantastic!
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally the numbatdata is in a format specified in the database itself "Wallaby 2 file". However through my googling I have not found any relational databases which refer to Wallaby 2. I have noticed that these files are likely SQLITE3 based, as numerous SQLITE temporary files are created while performing grid reports for instance. Otherwise, I am not aware of any specification for these files. If anyone ever has some time to give it a crack that'd be a great help!

            Currently only reading from transportable databases has been implemented. Long term it would be great if we could write to transportable databases and ultimately have complete control over the contents of it, to fix it as required and download the newer version. If this is understood as a requirement then <code>TransportableItem</code> should be given a method which returns a file collection object of pre-written files required for import.

            If you have any suggestions for improvements to the library feel free to raise them as an Issue <a href="https://github.com/sancarn/InnovyzeTransportableJS/issues">on github</a>. You can also branch the repository and make pull requests to get features intergrated into the library faster.
          </p>

          <p>So to recap here's the ToDo list:</p>

          <li>Intergrated Type wrappers for different model objects</li>
          <li>Blob parser</li>
          <li>Wallaby 2 parser</li>
          <li>Writing data to and downloading the new transportable database</li>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
              All in all, I have speant a fair amount of my free time over the past few weeks building this project. I really hope this ends up being helpful to others. I know at least from our own client's at <a href="https://www.pickeverard.co.uk/">PickEverard</a> this will be a fantastic tool for them and allow them to check transportable databases provided by ourselves and the other SMP consultants working for them!
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently this has been entirely self funded. If you would like specific features implemented for your own processes then I am more than happy to discuss an arrangement which works for the both of us. Please feel free to <a href="sancarn.github.io/Business/Contact">get in contact</a>!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Enjoy!
